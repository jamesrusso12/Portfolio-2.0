                                <br>Currently, I am enrolled as a student at Boise
                                State University, where I am nearing the completion of my major. My field of study is
                                Games Interactive Media & Mobile (G.I.M.M.), which I find to be immensely fascinating
                                and engrossing. Through this program, I have been able to hone my skills in developing
                                games using C# in the Unity engine, as well as designing and modeling 3D objects and
                                environments. While learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was introduced to the
                                intricacies of MYSQL and PHP databases, which proved to be a steep learning curve.
                                However, I persevered and was ultimately able to develop compelling websites that
                                incorporated CRUD API. My objective is to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in the fall
                                of 2025, thereby completing my academic journey.

                                was the UI/UX of the website. I worked closely with one of my group memebers so that we
                                could bring out our best work and create the best possible tool to help students.

                    <p>Web design is a skill that I have diligently cultivated, and I take pride in the projects I've successfully completed. Over the years, I've honed my ability to create websites through full-stack development techniques. Additionally, I've expanded my capabilities by optimizing the use of tools like D3.js and MYSQL with PHP to create more captivating websites, incorporating dynamic databases. This expertise has empowered me to craft and personalize my own portfolio. Currently, I'm in the process of acquiring proficiency in AWS, which is enhancing my web development skills. Personally, I've always had an affinity for UI/UX design and am well-versed in both Google and Apple design practices, with a continuous drive to expand my knowledge in web design.

                    <p>Creating and building within Unity has been a cherished pursuit of mine, allowing me to channel my creative interests effectively into game development. Leveraging my proficiency in C#, I've successfully crafted a range of games, from 2D platformers to immersive VR experiences. Each project has provided valuable insights and deepened my knowledge. In one of my initial endeavors, I created a fully functional 2D platformer game complete with AI-driven enemies, player health and damage systems, wall-running mechanics, and more. Currently, I'm engaged in my final project, a 3D environment project where I'm designing my own models and textures, ultimately transforming it into a VR first-person shooter game. My passion for game design is unwavering, particularly when utilizing tools like Unity, C#, Maya, and Blender.

My exposure to web and game development design has provided me with a valuable perspective on approaching new projects. Understanding the intricacies of game development and design has made me adaptable in tackling tasks and shaping 3D models. This aptitude for design extends to creating engaging gameplay and level design, focusing on enhancing accessibility and user enjoyment. I have a genuine enthusiasm for collaborative work, thriving in team settings, and taking on diverse challenges to design projects effectively and efficiently.

This screen shot shows the 3d models of buildings I've made in pro-builder which I will soon sculpt and texture in Maya. I am currently expanding my knowledge on 3D modeling in Maya now in my junior year.

                            <p>I collaborated with a team to develop an innovative iOS game that combines a 2D platformer with augmented reality (AR) functionality. By utilizing X-code and Unity, we crafted a captivating experience where players can scan playing cards on their mobile devices to grant power-ups to their teammates, with my responsibility focused on Unity, including sprite integration and level design.
