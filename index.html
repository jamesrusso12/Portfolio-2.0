                                <br>Currently, I am enrolled as a student at Boise
                                State University, where I am nearing the completion of my major. My field of study is
                                Games Interactive Media & Mobile (G.I.M.M.), which I find to be immensely fascinating
                                and engrossing. Through this program, I have been able to hone my skills in developing
                                games using C# in the Unity engine, as well as designing and modeling 3D objects and
                                environments. While learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was introduced to the
                                intricacies of MYSQL and PHP databases, which proved to be a steep learning curve.
                                However, I persevered and was ultimately able to develop compelling websites that
                                incorporated CRUD API. My objective is to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in the fall
                                of 2025, thereby completing my academic journey.

                                was the UI/UX of the website. I worked closely with one of my group memebers so that we
                                could bring out our best work and create the best possible tool to help students.

                    <p>Web design is a skill that I have diligently cultivated, and I take pride in the projects I've
                        successfully completed. Over the years, I've honed my ability to create websites through
                        full-stack development techniques. Additionally, I've expanded my capabilities by optimizing the
                        use of tools like D3.js and MYSQL with PHP to create more captivating websites, incorporating
                        dynamic databases. This expertise has empowered me to craft and personalize my own portfolio.
                        Currently, I'm in the process of acquiring proficiency in AWS, which is enhancing my web
                        development skills. Personally, I've always had an affinity for UI/UX design and am well-versed
                        in both Google and Apple design practices, with a continuous drive to expand my knowledge in web
                        design.

                        my creative interests effectively into game development. Leveraging my proficiency in C#, I've
                        successfully crafted a range of games, from 2D platformers to immersive VR experiences. Each
                        project has provided valuable insights and deepened my knowledge. In one of my initial
                        endeavors, I created a fully functional 2D platformer game complete with AI-driven enemies,
                        player health and damage systems, wall-running mechanics, and more. Currently, I'm engaged in my
                        final project, a 3D environment project where I'm designing my own models and textures,
                        ultimately transforming it into a VR first-person shooter game. My passion for game design is
                        unwavering, particularly when utilizing tools like Unity, C#, Maya, and Blender.
